# Spring project - REACT20K BCH, February 2020

This repo contains the spring project for REACT20K group at Business College Helsinki. Every student built their own portfolio page inside their respective folder, trying to include libraries and tricks we had learnt in the first two months of classes.

## My contribution

In the "beata" folder there is my personal portfolio website - a horizontal website built mainly with JavaScript, HTML, CSS and external libraries. It shows my skills, education, experience and serves as my web developer CV.

## Built With

- HTML5, CSS3
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - icons
